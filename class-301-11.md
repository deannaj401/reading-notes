# Reading 11

This was 5 videos about EJS

Its kind of hard to to do the notes for this so I will just summarize what each video was about


**VIDEO 1 : Intro to EJS - Overview -1**

This was literally an introduction and overview where he talked about what he was going to go over in the next 6 videos

**Video 2: Intro to EJS - Getting Started - 2**

In this video he set up his server by installing the dependencies and setting up his routes. He installed express cors path and bodyParser and set his server to listen at 8000

**Video 3: Intro to EJS - Injecting values into the views -3**

In this video he introduced the ```<%=``` ejs tags. It evaluates a variable or an object or an array for you and puts a variable into the ejs view. You can even put it into an image tag or a link
or an API call

**Video 4 Intro to EJS - For Loops and Arrays -4**

 In this video he talked about how to iterate over an array value. 
Here was the code he did in the index.ejs

```app.get('/', function(request, response) {```
```response.render('index', {```
   ```people: [```
    ```{name: 'dave'},```
     ```{name: 'jerry'},```
    ```]```

```<ul>```
```<% for(var person of people) { %>```
```<li><%=person.name%></li>```
```<% }>```
```</ul>```

**the output was**
* dave
* jerry




**Video  5 Intro to EJS - IF/Else Statement -5**

 In this video he talked about if/else statements. Here was the code he used

```<ul>```
```<% for(var person of people) { %>```
```if(person.name === 'dave') { %>```

```<li> This is Definitley <%=person.name%>!!!</li>```

  ``` <% } else { %```

```<li> This is Definitley NOT dave!!! This is <%=person.name%></li>``` 

```</ul>```

The output was

This is definitley dave

This is definitley not dave!!! This is jerry
