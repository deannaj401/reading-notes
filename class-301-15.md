# Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

There is a huge gender gap in technology. This was not always the case. In the early days it was a lot more even but since video games have come out it has become a man's world.

Programming is one of the best paying jobs you can have today but women are not encouraged to participate in this. In states like Mississippi, Montana(Where I live) and Wyoming not a single girl took an AP-level computer science course examiniation in 2014. 

Elizabeth Ames from the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology believes that one of  Primary reasons for this is the correlation between computing and gaming in the 80s. Most of the video games were aimed at boys and men and so they had an advantage when it came to Game Creation.

The Apple personal computer was marketed specifically to boys. The ad showed them teasing girl's computer skills. The video talks about how Brian is going to be an astronaut or a marine biologist. They make the little girl in the video look like she doesn't know how to really use the computer and needs lots of help from the teacher. 

Two words Game Boy. Enough Said

Women opted out of computer courses early because it was so male oriented. 

An American Association of University Women review of more than 380 studies from academic journals, corporations, and government sources found that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates “more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects.” By the time students now reach university, 20% of men plan to take on a career in engineering or computing. Among women, that number is just 5.8%. Women start out so far behind that they often can’t catch up.


Women have problems even after they do make it into the field. There is a lack of female role models and its hard to break into the buddy networks. Until there is a change in this attitude there is a subtle message to women and girls that this is not where they belong

On a personal note. I wanted to learn computer programming when I was in high school. When I told my (male) guidance counselor he said "ok. that sounds good" and proceeded to try to get me set up in a secretary course. I told him no I want to do programming and he said " oh that might be a little hard for you to do if you want to have a family because they have to work long hours and go to college for a really long time sweetheart".  It took me another 30 years to figure out that he was full of it and that it was actually possible for me to learn programming. Its attitudes like this that makes it hard for women to break into this field. 

# Diversity in Tech

I looked at the chart and it appears that most of the companies are prominiently white males. This really needs to change. This does not reflect the demographic of the most computer users. I think this is mostly because white males are the most encouraged to go into this field and have access to those opportunities. 

# Why Diversity matters to your tech company

## 5 reasons

1. Diverse Teams are smarter and more creative

Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

2. Diverse companies perform better

In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

3. Companies are losing out on great talent

By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 

4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base

"We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."

5. Its the right thing to do

he tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality. Others have emphasized a concern that by failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community members’ ideas.
