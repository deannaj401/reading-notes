# Functional Programming

**Functional Programming** - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathmatical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**Pure Functions** - returns the same result if given the same arguments and also does not cause any observable side effects
**also known as determanistic**

**Impure Function** - uses a global object that is not passed as a parameter to the function. and returns a different result for the same parameter. 

* If a function reads external files it is not a pure function because the file's contents can change. 
* Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure


**Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference**

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after itâ€™s created.

**functional chaining** - the result of a function will be used as an input for the next function without modifying the original input string

**referential transparency** - a function that consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Functions as 1st Class entities

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

Functions as first-class entities can:

* refer to it from constants and variables
* pass it as a parameter to other functions
* return it as result from other functions

**high-order functions** - either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result

**imperative approach** - if we have a collection of integers and only want the even numbers
* create an empty array 
* iterate over the  array
* push the even numbers to the  array

To use the filter method to do the same thing

```const even = n => n % 2 == 0;```
```const listOfNumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];```
```listOfNumbers.filter(even); // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]```

**map** - transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values

**reduce** - receives a function and a collection and returns a value created by combining the items.

# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

There weren't really any notes to take for this. Basically it was 3 examples of refactoring code very quickly. I did bookmark the site in case i needed to look at the examples.
