# EJS Partials

Partials are used when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. They make large websites easier to maintain because you don't have to change text on every page it appears on. Instead you can define that reusable code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

In EJS any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax used in a template is always surrounded by:
```<%%>```

Example of a partial

```<%-include(Partial_File)%>```
**the Partial_File is the template you use it in**

 * The ```<%- %>``` tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…
