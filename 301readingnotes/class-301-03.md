# Templating with Mustache.js

**Mustache is a logic-less template syntax used for HTML, config files, source code..etc**
	* it works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object

*logic-less means there are no IF statements, ELSE clauses or FOR loops only tags*

```mustache.js``` is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript that is considered the base for JS templating. It supports various languages and doesn't need a seperate templating system on the server side.

Example of Mustache syntax:

```Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });```
```// returns: Hello, Sherlynn```

* the braces around ```{{name}}``` is called a **placeholder**. 
	* When compiled Mustache looks for the 'name' property in the object
	* Then it replaces ```{{name}}``` with the actual value (Sherlynn)

Mustache is NOT a template engine
It is a **specification** for a templating language

## Mustache-Express

Use this if you want to use Mustache with Node and Express

This is how you install it in the terminal

```$ npm install mustache --save```

Configure mustache-express in your server.js/app.js/index.js file

```var mustacheExpress = require('mustache-express');```
```app.engine('html', mustacheExpress());```
```app.set('view engine', 'html');```
```app.set('views, _dirname + '/src/views');```

Create a views folder and add some html view templates:

views
* book.html
* hello.html
* index.html

Add the HTML markup

```<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>```

Then in the router configuration, use 

```res.render(TEMPLATE_NAME, JSON_DATA).```

Example:

```res.render('hello', {"name": "Sherlynn"})```

 1. the first parameter ‘hello’ refers to the hello.html file
	* no need to include the extension as it has been previously set as html

1. The second parameter is the JSON data

example

```var nameObject = {"name": "Sherlynn"}```
```res.render('hello', nameObject)```

#  A Complet Guide to Flexbox

## Background

**flexbox** -  a more efficient way to layout, align and distribute space among items in a container even when the size is unknown or dynamic

  	* A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.


Regular layouts are 

**Block**  -   vertically based 

**Inline**  -  horizontally based

Flexbox is **direction-agnostic**

**display** - defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex content for all its direct children
	* CSS columns have no effect on a flex container

**flex-direction** - establishes the main-axis and defines the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. 
	* Flexbox is a single direction layout concept
	* They layout either in horizontal rows or vertical columns

1. *row* - (default) left to right
1. *row-reverse* - right to left
1. *column* - same as row but top to bottom
1. *column-reverse* - bottom to top

```.container { ```

```flex-direction: row;```

```}```

**flex-wrap** - allow items to wrap as needed
	* by default flex items will all try to fit on one line

1. *nowrap* - (default) all flex items will be on one line
1. *wrap* - flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from top to bottom
1. *wrap-reverse* - flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

```.container { ```

``` flex-wrap: nowrap;```

```}```

**flex-flow*** - shorthand for the **flex-direction** and **flex-wrap** properties which together define the flex containers main and cross axes

*row nowrap* - default

```.container { ```

``` flex-flow: row nowrap;```

```}```

**justify-content** - defines the alignment along the main axis and helps distribute extra free space leftover when:
	* all the flex items on a line are inflexible OR
	* are flexible but have reached their maximum size
	* also controls the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

*flex-start* - (default) items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.

*flex-end* - items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction

*start* - items are packed toward the start of the **writing-mode** direction

*end* - items are packed toward the end of the **writing-mode** direction

*left* - items are packed toward left edge of the container

	* unless that doesn't make sense with the **flex-direction** 
	*then it behaves like **start**
*right* - items are packed toward right edge of the container

	* unless that doesn't make sense with the **flex-direction** 
	*then it behaves like **start**
*center* - items are centered along the line

*space-between* - items are evenly distributed in the line

	* first item is on the start line
	* last item  is on the end line
*space-around* - items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them

	* the spaces aren't equal since all the items have equal space on both sides
	1. first item will have one unit of space against the container edge
	1. the next item will have 2 units because it has its own spacing
*space-evenly* - items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (space to the edges is equal).


```.container { ```

``` justify-content: flex-start;```

```}```

**order** - controls the order in which they appear in the flex container
	* by default flex items are laid out in the source order
```.item {```
    ```order: 5;```

```}```

* the default order is 0

**flex-grow** - defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary
	1. accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion and dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up
	*  If all items have **flex-grow** set to 1 the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children.
	* If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others.
	*Negative numbers are invalid

```.item {```
    ```flex-grow: 4;```
```}``

**flex-shrink** - defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary

```.item {```
    ``` flex-shrink: 3;```
```}```

*Negative numbers are invalid

**flex-basis** - defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
	* it can be a length(20%, 5rem,) or a keyword
	* the **auto** keyword means width or height property
	* the **content**size based on the item's content

```.item {```
    ``` flex-basis: |auto;```
```}```

if set to 0 the extra space around content isnt factored in 
if set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on it's **flex-grow** value

**flex** - shorthand for **flex-grow**, **flex-shrink*, *flex-basis* combined
	* the default is 0 1 auto,

** It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.**


**align-self* - allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
  
* float clear and vertical-align have no effect on a flex item
