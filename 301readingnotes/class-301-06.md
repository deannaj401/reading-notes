# Node.js

**V8 engine** - the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

**node.js** - is a JavaScript runtime

the download page for node.js is 
```https://nodejs.org/en/download```

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing 

```node -v.```

Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm

* In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.

the linter for node is called **jshint**



 Node.js runs JavaScript on the server

It is single threaded and **event-driven** which means that every thing that happens in Node is in reaction to an event

Node uses libraries and is capable of handing a large number of simultaneous connections

The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload

## The Node Execution Model

1. Node apps pass async tasks to the event loop, along with a callback
1. The event loop efficiently manages a thread pool and executes tasks efficiently
1. Then executes each call back as tasks complete

*blocking I/0 calls should be avoided*

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded


Node makes it easier to share code between the server and the client. It speaks JSON and it is considered easier than other server-side languages
