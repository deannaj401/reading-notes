# The Call Stack

**call stack** - a mechanism for an interpreter like JavaScript to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions such as
	* what function is being run 
	* what functions are called from within that function


Order of the Call Stack

1. When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.

1. Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.

1.When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.

1. If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

*We start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.*

# Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

**LIFO** - Last In First Out it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses  (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation 

**Temporarily Store** - Temporarily store: When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

**Manage function invocation (call)**: The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

**Stack Overflow** - A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

Key Takeaways

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
1. Code execution is synchronous.
1. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
1. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.

# JavaScript error messages && debugging

## Types of Errors

**Reference Error** - usually get when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared. Can also get this when using const and let
	* when getting this error using const and let is called Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ)

*FIX* - declare the variable before any declaration is made

**Syntax Error** - occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

*FIX* - fix the syntax

**Range Error** - happens when trying to manipulate an object with some kind of length and it is given an invalid length
* example - giving an array a negative length

**Type Error** - occurs when the the types you are trying to use or access are incompatible
* example - accessing a property in an undefined type of variable

*FIX* - check and make sure the variable exists

# Debugging

The easiest way to debug your JavaScript is to use ```console.log()```

a breakpoint can be acheived by putting a debugger statement in your code

To add a conditional breakpoint right click a previous set breakpoint
	* This will make your program stop at that point only if a condition is met.


## Call Stack

**IIFE** - Immediately Invoked Function Expression

you can add console.trace() to find the stack trace

To avoid runtime errors you can use the following tools

1. quokka
1. eslint
1. TypeScript
