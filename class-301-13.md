# Sending Form Data

## Client Server Architecture

1.  A client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server
1. The server answers the request using the same protocol

**the ```<form>``` element defines how the data will be sent**

The 2 most important attributes are 

1. *action* - defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page.
 
Example:
```<form action="https://example.com">```

**The names and values of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as ```name=value``` pairs joined with &. The action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).**

1. *method* - defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

*GET method* - the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource

*POST method* - the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request

**When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL**

*Content-Length header* -  indicates the size of the body
*Content-Type header* -  indicates the type of resource sent to the server.

**HTTP requests are never displayed to the user. The only thing displayed to the user is the URL called**

This is important because

1. If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.
1. If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.

## Retrieving Data

**PHP** - offers some global objects to access the data

Other languages that can be used for form handling are
Perl, Java, .Net and Ruby

**enctype attribute** - lets you specify the value of the Content-Type HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted. This header is very important because it tells the server what kind of data is being sent. By default, its value is ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded```. In human terms, this means: "This is form data that has been encoded into URL parameters."

The 3 extra steps to send files:

1. Set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.

1. Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).

1. Include one or more ```<input type="file">``` controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded.
